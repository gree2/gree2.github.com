            use apache hbase software when you need random, realtime read/write access to your big data. this project's goal is the hosting of very large tables -- billions of rows x millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware. hbase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented store modeled after google's bigtable: a distributed storage system for structured data by chang et al. just as bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the google file system, hbase provides bigtable-like capabilities on top of hadoop and hdfs.   

### hive  

1. [site](http://hive.apache.org/)

1. cate `database`

1. lang  `java`

1. desc

            the apache hive (tm) data warehouse software facilitates querying and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage. built on top of apache hadoop (tm), it provides * tools to enable easy data extract/transform/load (etl) * a mechanism to impose structure on a variety of data formats * access to files stored either directly in apache hdfs (tm) or in other data storage systems such as apache hbase (tm) * query execution via mapreduce hive defines a simple sql-like query language, called hiveql, that enables users familiar with sql to query the data. at the same time, this language also allows programmers who are familiar with the mapreduce framework to be able to plug in their custom mappers and reducers to perform more sophisticated analysis that may not be supported by the built-in capabilities of the language. hiveql can also be extended with custom scalar functions (udf's), aggregations (udaf's), and table functions (udtf's).   

### kafka 

1. [site](http://kafka.apache.org/)

1. cate `big-data`

1. lang  `scala`

1. desc

            a single kafka broker can handle hundreds of megabytes of reads and writes per second from thousands of clients. kafka is designed to allow a single cluster to serve as the central data backbone for a large organization. it can be elastically and transparently expanded without downtime. data streams are partitioned and spread over a cluster of machines to allow data streams larger than the capability of any single machine and to allow clusters of co-ordinated consumers. kafka has a modern cluster-centric design that offers strong durability and fault-tolerance guarantees. messages are persisted on disk and replicated within the cluster to prevent data loss. each broker can handle terabytes of messages without performance impact. 

### knox  

1. [site](http://knox.apache.org/)

1. cate `big-data`

1. lang  `java`

1. desc

            the apache knox gateway is a rest api gateway for interacting with hadoop clusters. the knox gateway provides a single access point for all rest interactions with hadoop clusters. in this capacity, the knox gateway is able to provide valuable functionality to aid in the control, integration, monitoring and automation of critical administrative and analytical needs of the enterprise. authentication (ldap and active directory authentication provider) federation/sso (http header based identity federation) authorization (service level authorization) auditing while there are a number of benefits for unsecured hadoop clusters, the knox gateway also complements the kerberos secured cluster quite nicely. coupled with proper network isolation of a kerberos secured hadoop cluster, the knox gateway provides the enterprise with a solution that: integrates well with enterprise identity management solutions protects the details of the hadoop cluster deployment (hosts and ports are hidden from endusers) simplifies the number of services that clients need to interact with

1. cate `big-data`

1. lang  `java/js`

### parque

1. [site](http://parquet.apache.org/)

1. cate `big-data`

1. [site](http://phoenix.apache.org/)

1. cate `big-data/database`

1. lang  `java/sql`

1. desc

            apache phoenix is a relational database layer on top of apache hbase. it is accessed as a jdbc driver and enables querying, updating, and managing hbase tables through standard sql. instead of using map-reduce, apache phoenix compiles your sql query into a series of hbase scans and orchestrates the running of those scans to produce regular jdbc result sets. direct use of the hbase api, along with coprocessors and custom filters, results in performance on the order of milliseconds for small queries, or seconds for tens of millions of rows.   

### pig

1. [site](http://pig.apache.org/)

1. cate `database`

1. lang  `java`

1. desc

            apache pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. the salient property of pig programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them to handle very large data sets. pig's infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces sequences of map-reduce programs. pig's language layer consists of a textual language called pig latin, which has the following key properties: * ease of programming. it is trivial to achieve parallel execution of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks. complex tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data transformations are explicitly encoded as data flow sequences, making them easy to write, understand, and maintain. * optimization opportunities. the way in which tasks are encoded permits the system to optimize their execution automatically, allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than efficiency. * extensibility. users can create their own functions to do special-purpose processing. 

### solr  

1. [site](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/)

1. cate `web-framework/network-server`

1. lang  `java`

1. desc
