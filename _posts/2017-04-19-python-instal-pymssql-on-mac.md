            ==> Caveats
            This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local.

            This is an alternate version of another formula.

            If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
              echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/freetds@0.91/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

            For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
                LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/freetds@0.91/lib
                CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/freetds@0.91/include
