### what is data science

            there's a joke that says
            a data scientist is someone
            who knows more statistics
            than a computer scientist
            and more computer science
            than a statistician

### code

1. friendship

    1. a list of users

            users = [
                { "id": 0, "name": "Hero" },
                { "id": 1, "name": "Dunn" },
                { "id": 2, "name": "Sue" },
                { "id": 3, "name": "Chi" },
                { "id": 4, "name": "Thor" },
                { "id": 5, "name": "Clive" },
                { "id": 6, "name": "Hicks" },
                { "id": 7, "name": "Devin" },
                { "id": 8, "name": "Kate" },
                { "id": 9, "name": "Klein" }
            ]

    1. relation

            friendships = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4),
                (4, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 9)]

            # (0, 1) indicates that data scientist with id 0 Hero
            # and the data scientist with id 1 Dunn are friends

    1. dot representation

            graph friendship {
                0 -- 1;
                0 -- 2;
                1 -- 2;
                1 -- 3;
                2 -- 3;
                3 -- 4;
                4 -- 5;
                5 -- 6;
                5 -- 7;
                6 -- 8;
                7 -- 8;
                8 -- 9;
            }

1. add `friends` to `users`

    1. init

            for user in users:
                user['friends'] = []

            for i, j in friendships:
                # add j as a friend of i
                users[i]['friends'].append(users[j])
                # ditto
                users[j]['friends'].append(users[i])

    1. how many

            def number_of_friends(user):
                """how many friends does _user_ have?"""
                return len(user['friends'])

            total_connections = sum(number_of_friends(user) for user in users)

    1. average

            from __feature__ import division
            num_users = len(users)
            avg_connections = total_connections / num_users

    1. sort

            # a list of (user_id, number_of_friends)
            num_friends_by_id = [(user['id'], number_of_friends(user)) for user in users]

            # sort by num_friends
            sorted(num_friends_by_id,
                   key=lambda (user_id, num_friends): num_friends,
                   reverse=True
            )

1. friends of friend

    1. bad implementation

            def friends_of_friend_ids_bad(user):
                # "foaf" is short for "friend of a firend"
                return [foaf['id']
                        for friend in user['friends']
                        for foaf in friend['friends']
                ]

            friends_of_friend_ids_bad(users[0])
            # [0, 2, 3, 0, 1, 3]

    1. new implementation

            from collections import Counter

            def not_the_same(user, other_user):
                """two users are not the same if they have different ids"""
                return user['id'] != other_user['id']

            def not_friends(user, other_user):
                """other_user is not a friend if he's not in user['friends'];
                i.e. if he's not_the_same as all the people in user['friends']"""
                return all(not_the_same(firend, other_user)
                           for friend in user['friends']
                )

            def friends_of_friend_ids(user):
                return Counter(foaf['id']
                               for friend in user['friends']
                               for foaf in friend['friends']
                               if not_the_same(user, foaf)
                               and not_friends(user, foaf)
                )

            print friends_of_friend_ids(users[3])
            # Counter({0: 2, 5: 1})
