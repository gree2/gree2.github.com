1. ease of use

	* write apps quickly in java, scala or python

	* spark offers over 80 high-level operators that make it easy to build parallel apps

	* and you can use it interactively from the scala and python shells

1. generality

	* combine sql, streaming, and complex analytics

	* spark powers a stack of high-level tools including [Spark SQL](http://spark.apache.org/sql/), [MLlib](http://spark.apache.org/mllib/) for machine learning, [GraphX](http://spark.apache.org/graphx/), and [Spark Streaming](http://spark.apache.org/streaming/)
