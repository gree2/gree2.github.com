### info

* [Nmap](http://nmap.org/) is short for network mapper
* it is an open source security tool for network exploration, security scanning and auditing
* it was designed to rapidly scan large networks
* nmap uses `raw ip packets` in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network
* what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering
* what operating system (and os versions) they are running
* what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use

### sample setup (lab)

                          +---------+
    +---------+           | Network |         +---------+
    | server1 |-----------+ switch  +---------| server2 |
    +---------+           | (sw0)   |         +---------+
                          +----+----+
                               |
                               |
                     +---------+--------+
                     | wks01 Linux/OSX  |
                     +------------------+

* `wks01` is your computer

    * running linux/os x or unix like os

    * used for scanning your local network

    * `nmap` command must be installed

* `server1`

    * powered by linux/unix/ms-windows os

    * this is an unpatched server

    * install a few services such as a web-server, file server and so on

* `server2`

    * powered by linux/unix/ms-windows os

    * this is a fully patched server with firewall

    * install a few services such as a web-server, file server and so on

* all three systems are connected via switch `sw0`

### scanning

1. scan a single host or an ip address (ipv4)

    * ip address

            $ nmap 192.168.1.104

    * host name

            $ nmap server1

    * host name with more info

            $ nmap -v 192.168.1.104

    * this is useful for debugging (ip, route, netstat command)

            $ nmap --iflist

1. how do i scan specific ports

    * scan port 80

            $ nmap -p 80 192.168.1.104

    * scan TCP port 80

            $ nmap -p T:80 192.168.1.104

    * scan UDP port 53

            $ nmap -p U:53 192.168.1.104

    * scan two ports

            $ nmap -p 80,443 192.168.1.104

    * scan port range

            $ nmap -p 80-200 192.168.1.104

    * combine all options

            $ nmap -p U:53,111,135,T:21-25,80,139,8080 192.168.1.104

    * scan all port with `wildcard`

            $ nmap -p "*" 192.168.1.104

    * scan top ports i.e. scan `$number` most common ports

            $ nmap --top-ports  5 192.168.1.104
            $ nmap --top-ports 10 192.168.1.104

            $ nmap -T5 192.168.1.0/24

1. how do i detect remote os

    * you can identify a remote host apps and os using -O option

            $ nmap -O 192.168.1.104

            TCP/IP fingerprinting (for OS scan) requires root privileges.

1. scan for IP protocol

    * to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are supported by target machines

            $ nmap -sO 192.168.1.104

1. scan a firewall for security weakness

    * exploit a subtle loophole in the TCP and good for testing security of common attacks

    * TCP Null scan to fool a firewall to generate a response
     
            # does not set any bits (TCP flag header is o)
            $ nmap -sN 192.168.1.104

            # sets just the TCP FIN bit

            $ nmap -sX 192.168.1.104

1. scan a firewall for packets fragments

    * the `-f` option causes the requested scan (including ping scans) to use tiny fragmented IP packets

    * the idea is to split up the TCP header over several packets to make it harder for packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and other annoyances to detect what you are doing

            $ nmap -f 192.168.1.104

1. cloak a scan with decoys

    * the `-D` option it appear to the remote host that the host(s) you specify as [decoys are scanning the target network too](http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/nmap-hide-ipaddress-with-decoy-ideal-scan.html)

    * thus their IDS might report 5-10 port scans from unique IP addresses

    * but they won't know which IP was scanning them and which were innocent decoys

            $ nmap -n -Ddecoy-ip1,decoy-ip2,your-own-ip,decoy-ip3,decoy-ip4 remote-host-ip

1. scan a firewall for MAC address spoofing

    * spoof your MAC address

            $ nmap --spoof-mac MAC-ADDRESS-HERE 192.168.1.104

    * add other option

            $ nmap -v -sT -PN --spoof-mac MAC-ADDRESS-HERE 192.168.1.104

    * use a random MAC address

            # the number 0 means nmap chooses a completely random MAC address
            $ nmap -v -sT -PN --spoof-mac 0 192.168.1.104

            $ nmap -oN /tmp/output.txt 192.168.1.104
            $ nmap -oN output.txt 192.168.1.104

1. not a fan of command line tools

    * try [zenmap the official network mapper](http://nmap.org/zenmap/) front end
