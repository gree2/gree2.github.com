### probability

1. dependence and independence

    1. e and f are independent

            P(E,F) = P(E)P(F)

1. conditional probability

    1. e and f are not independent

            P(E|F) = P(E,F)/P(F)

            # rewrite as this
            P(E,F) = P(E|F)P(F)

            # when e and f are independent
            P(E|F) = P(E)

    1. `b` both children are girls `g` the older child is a girl

            P(B|G) = P(B,G)/P(G) = P(B)/P(G) = 1/2

    1. `b` both children are gilrs `l` at the least one of them is a girl

            P(B|L) = P(B,L)/P(L) = P(B)/P(L) = 1/3

    1. check

            def random_kid():
                return random.choice(['boy', 'girl'])

            both_girls = 0
            older_girl = 0
            either_girl = 0
            random.seed(0)
            for _ in range(10000):
                younger = random_kid()
                older = random_kid()
                if older == 'girl':
                    older_girl += 1
                if older == 'girl' and younger == 'girl':
                    both_girls += 1
                if older == 'girl' or younger == 'girl':
                    either_girl += 1

            print 'p(both | older)', both_girls / older_girl    # 0.514 ~ 1/2
            print 'p(both | either)', both_girls / either_girl  # 0.342 ~ 1/3

1. bayes's theorem

            P(E|F) = P(E,F)/P(F) = P(F|E)P(E)/P(F)

            # given
            P(F) = P(F,E) + P(F,Â¬E)

            # so
            P(E|F) = P(F|E)P(E)/[P(F|E)P(E)+P(F|Â¬E)P(Â¬E)]

### continuous distribution

1. probability density function `pdf`

    1. density function for the uniform distribution

            def uniform_pdf(f):
                return 1 if x >= 0 and x < 1 else 0

1. cumulative distribution function `cdf`

            def uniform_cdf(x):
                """returns the probability that a uniform random variable is <= x"""

                # uniform random is never less than 0
                if x < 0 return 0
                # e.g. P(X <= 0.4) = 0.4
                elif x < 1 return x
                #uniform random is aways less than 1
                else: return 1

### normal distribution
